Readme

This is a (very) short text-based adventure game (similar to Zork)

Basic supported commands are:
	Allez
	Parlez
	Prenez
	Regardez
	Donnez

In the vous form (e.g. "Parlez <<Bonjour!>>", "Allez a droite", etc).

Available directions are a gauche, a droite, tout droit, and derriere. For simplicity's sake, always assume that you are always facing north (if you go a gauche and then go back a droite, you end up at the same place).

You are encouraged to greet people you meet by asking how they are and what their name is (even if you technically already know their name).

In case of bugs, there is an included spoilers file with the intended game "storyline"

Pardon my French.
